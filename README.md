# Sales Prediction

## Objective
Predict the sales volume of potential new products in four different product types (laptops, PC, smartphones and netbooks) using regression models. Also investigate the relationship between customer and service reviews and the sales volume.

## Summary 
After investigating the provided sales dataset we have discovered that most relevant attributes are 4 star reviews , positive review and, in modelling stage adding shipping weight have impaired model performance. Regarding the impact of customer and service reviews on sales volume we can observe a relation between those attributes, also the high sales volume products tend to have lower shipping weight. 
### Conclusions
Our model can explain up 98% of results in the dataset ,based on performance metric. It performs better with the sales volume lower than 500.
